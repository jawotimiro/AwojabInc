<h3><a name="Elicitation"></a> Integrating African Immigrant into the Canadian Job Market – A Case Study</h3>
<p>Based on personal, documented facts and interaction with various Immigrants of African extraction, Integrating into Canadian Job Market is a very interesting subject that we thought deserves a careful study with the objective of providing future immigrants and those yet to be properly established in the system with facts and leads that may help them to achieve their objectives of relocating from their original home countries to Canada. Bearing in mind that Africa is made up of 54 countries and coverage of the population for the purpose of this research will be tasking. Hence our approach is to limit our sample population to few countries as a starting point and later pole our sample population from sub-regional African divisions and ultimately come up with a report that will be representative of the entire continent.</p><hr /></div>
